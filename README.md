That's a fantastic next step\! A well-structured `README.md` is essential for any GitHub project.

Here is a comprehensive `README.md` template tailored specifically for your **Groq + LangChain Medical Diagnosis Agent** project, covering setup, architecture, and key features like research logging.

# üß† Groq-MedQA-RAG-Agent

A high-speed, multi-step medical diagnosis and treatment planning chatbot built with **LangChain**, powered by **Groq's** Llama 3.1 LLM, and utilizing a persistent **FAISS** vector store based on the MedQA dataset for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

This application is designed for **LLM research and evaluation**, automatically logging detailed pipeline results (symptoms, diagnosis, context, treatment) to a CSV file.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Multi-Step Agent Pipeline:** A sequential process involving a **Symptom Extractor**, a **RAG-based Diagnoser** (using FAISS), and a **Treatment Planner**.
* **Groq Integration:** Leverages the incredible speed of the Groq API for rapid inference and lower latency in the agent steps.
* **FAISS Persistence:** The MedQA dataset is converted into a FAISS index using **HuggingFace BGE Embeddings** and persisted to disk. The application loads the index instantly on startup, eliminating the need to rebuild the vector store every time.
* **Continuous Research Logging:** Features a batch test mode that **appends** all query results, extracted context, and timestamps to a persistent `medqa_research_master_log.csv` for easy analysis and performance tracking.
* **Streamlit UI:** A clean, interactive interface for both single-query testing and batch research runs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup

### 1. Prerequisites

* **Python 3.8+**
* A **Groq API Key** (Get one from the [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys)).
* The **MedQA CSV Dataset** (This should be a CSV file with `question` and `answer` columns).

### 2. Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/Groq-MedQA-RAG-Agent.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/Groq-MedQA-RAG-Agent.git)
cd Groq-MedQA-RAG-Agent
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

*(You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file based on the imports in the Python script.)*

### 3\. API Key Configuration

For security, it is best practice to set your Groq API key as an environment variable. The code will look for it, but you can also replace the placeholder in `main.py` with your actual key if necessary.

```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="gsk_..."
```

### 4\. Running the Application

Start the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

## üöÄ Usage Guide

### 1\. Build/Load the Vector Store

1.  When you first run the app, it will look for the `faiss_medqa_index` folder.
2.  If the index is not found, use the **File Uploader** to upload your MedQA CSV file.
3.  Click the button to **Build and Save** the vector store. This will create the embeddings, index them with FAISS, and save them to disk for future use.

### 2\. Research Batch Testing

1.  Navigate to the **Research Logging & Batch Test** section.
2.  Enter multiple test queries, one per line.
3.  Click **Run Batch Test and Log Results**.
4.  The output will be appended to `medqa_research_master_log.csv`, and a download link for the master log will appear.

### 3\. Single Query Diagnosis

1.  Navigate to the **Single Query Diagnosis** section.
2.  Enter a detailed patient query (symptoms).
3.  The results will be displayed in a step-by-step format, showing:
      * The extracted symptoms.
      * The final diagnosis and explanation.
      * The suggested treatment plan.
      * The raw RAG context documents used from the FAISS index (for transparency).

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The system runs as a sequential, multi-agent chain:

```
[ User Query ] 
      |
      V
[ Agent 1: Symptom Extractor (LLMChain) ]  -> Extracts symptoms (e.g., "fever, cough, body aches")
      |
      V
[ Agent 2: RAG Diagnoser (Custom Function) ] -> RAG (Symptoms -> FAISS Search -> Context) -> LLM Prompt -> Diagnosis
      |
      V
[ Agent 3: Treatment Planner (LLMChain) ]  -> Diagnosis -> LLM Prompt -> Treatment Plan
      |
      V
[ Streamlit Output / CSV Logger ]
```

### LangChain Components Used:

  * **LLM:** `ChatGroq` (`llama-3.1-8b-instant`)
  * **Embeddings:** `HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings` (`BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`)
  * **Vector Store:** `FAISS`
  * **Chains:** `LLMChain` for sequential tasks
